  skos:definition "An MTG player is an agent who is playing a game of Magic: the Gathering."@en ;
  skos:note "Players are often referred to in card text and can be targeted by certain effects. Thus, this term is not intended to refer to players in the colloquial sense of 'individual who sometimes plays such-and-such a game." ;

  skos:note "this is a super loose definition, and this class should probably be subsumed under a more specific class, 'game', rather than BFO's process class. That, however, is beyond the scope of this project, and if you are unsure as to why, go read Wittgenstein or any philosophy of games." ;
