# MtgOnt
[Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) is the premier trading card game, in which players collect, trade, and build decks of cards which they use to play against eachother in competitive games. As of February 2024, there are about 27,000 unique cards which players may use in the various formats of this game, and a [comprehensive rulebook](https://media.wizards.com/2024/downloads/MagicCompRules%2020240802.pdf) of over 200 pages. As such, there is a huge, constantly growing body of information about the game which most casual players only know a fraction of. This repo is intended to serve as a space for the development of a [BFO-conformant](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020) ontology of Magic: the Gathering. 

#Scope 
MtgOnt asserts classes and relations corresponding to the types of objects and classes asserted in the [Comprehensive Rules](https://media.wizards.com/2024/downloads/MagicCompRules%2020240802.pdf), as subclasses of existing classes within the top-level ontology, [BFO](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020), and/or the mid-level ontology suite extending from BFO, [CCO](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies).
